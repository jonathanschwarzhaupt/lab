# Lab

This repository contains (or rather will contain) code and other snippets that I create or encounter along the way.

It serves as a place for documentation and experimentation as I have found that nothing beats practical applications rather than theoretical learning. Although I must emphasize that a  strong theoretical foundation is also very important!
