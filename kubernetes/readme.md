# Tinekring in Kubernetes
This directory contains Kubernetes manifests of tools and services I am trying out locally.

## Getting started
I recommend to use Rancher Desktop to spin up a local Kubernetes cluster. My experience with Rancher Desktop has been painless so far, making it easy to get up and running.

Select the Rancher Desktop context and apply any of the manifests, ensuring the correct order ;)
